            <h3>1/25/25: Various main menu UI has been worked on alongside some scripts for functionality.</h3>
                <p>This week was mainly attributed to the main menu functionality of Elysium: The Forsaken Dunegons. The updated home screen has now been completed and only needs to be polished. It features a 3d-rendering of your avatar alongside your avatar's class, race, and talents. Your primary and secondary weapons are also highlighted as well. Following this, the armor screen is being worked on and features two viewport frames (3d rendering) windows to show the armor you'd like to equip alongside the armor piece on your avatar. Other functionalities such as the UI color changing based off rarity of armor equipped alongside certain effects will be implmented in the foreseeable future.</p>
